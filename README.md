# ScreenScraper.fr Metadata plugin for Playnite

This plugin allows for getting metadata from ScreenScraper.fr in Playnite.

### Installation
Just open up the .pext file in Playnite to install

### Notes
* It is recommended to create a ScreenScraper.fr account and use your login credentials in the plugin settings.  This is not currently required, however.
* The plugin will try to match the game region based on the ROM filename.  If it is not found, then it will use the preferred regions in the plugin settings.  These region codes are comma delimited, e.g. ` us,wor,jp `, for US, World, Japan regions.  You can see all of the possible region codes [here](https://www.screenscraper.fr/api2/regionsListe.php?devid=xxx&devpassword=yyy&softname=zzz&output=xml&ssid=test&sspassword=test).
